git init (to setup github in vs code )
git remote add orgin <link> (to connect our folder that is this folder with github created repository)
git remote -v (to verify remote)
git branch (to check differnt braches present)(branch is,mainly there is one final code differnt branch take this main code and edit it and then push it to main.the final resilt is code presnt in main)(so in this way we can create differnt braches so that nobody has to wait for other person to complete and at last can merge it )

git branch -M main (to rename branch)

git add . (this add our code to a stage file ) 
git commit -m "" (this is use to commit in stage file )
git push -u orgin main (this is used to push the modified data to main branch)

git status (to know status)

git checkout -b <new branch name> (create a new branch)
git checkout <branch name>  (go to that branch)   
git branch -d <branch name> (delete that branch)

git diff <brachname>(to know the diffenrce in contentbetween two branches)

there is two way to merge

1.git pull origin main (this is used to merge the content in  feature1 braqnch with main)
2. git merge <branch name(if we are currently in feature branch then we have to write here main.to bring change in both branch we have to do the same in both branch)>

here we may get merge conflit that is for a particular same line of code both the brach may have written differnt so when merging this error will show in this the head is the current branch that we are in and incomming is the branch that we are merging with this branch 

git reset --hard <498b847b7923ef3a968ba887a9b40b294ec73b4a> (this is used to go back to particular commit the long code is particalr hash for each commit we can get this using git log)

git log (we get details about all the previous commit and the hashvalue of each commit like this commit e23f68539cd29e711119a70e7b996217de51c975) 

fork (this is used to copy some other person git hub repository and make a copy of that repository in out github account and we can make changes in it and it will change only in our repository for changes to occur in that person repository we will create a pull request and the person accept our changes then our code will get adedd there. fork option is presnt in the github page when we open some others repository)
